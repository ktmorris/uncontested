### Overview

>* Question: Does residing in an uncontested U.S. House district have an effect on casting a ballot at all? What are the ``upward" turnout effects of an absent down-ballot race?

>* Data: Voter registration data from the six states with multiple uncontested House races in the 2018 election 
>    * and Wisconsin (for the legislative election)

>* Method: A genetic matching model comparing registrants in contested and uncontested districts

>* Findings: The turnout effect is negative in five of the seven states (not CA and GA)
>    * and larger for the ``represented party" in five of the seven (not Texas and Wisconsin)


### Prior Literature I

>* Studies of uncontested House races
>    * More common in the South and predicted by incumbent's vote share in prior elections [@Squire1989; @Wrighton1997]

>* Patterns in American voting behavior
>    * Surge and decline in presidential and midterm election years [@Campbell1960; @Campbell1991]
>    * Roll-off in congressional and ballot measure contests [@Wattenberg2000; @Bullock1996; @Hall1987]
>    * Party-based mobilization [@Wielhouwer1994]


### Prior Literature II

>* Redistricting and representation
>    * Sorting [@Bishop2009] and ethnic turnout in majority-minority districts [@Griffin2006; @Fairdosi2015]
>    * "packing" and "cracking" for advantage
>    * Redistricting reduces turnout by disrupting incumbent recall [@Winburn2009; @Hayes2009]

### Data

>* Registered Voter Files
>    * Some directly from the state, some from Aristotle and L2
>    * These include a host of information about voters' age, sex, address, (sometimes) race, and others

>* SmartyStreets Geocoder + Census Data

>* We leverage the Bayesian racial probability estimate methodology developed by @Imai2016 for states without self-reported race data.

### Methodology

>* Genetic matching developed by @Sekhon2011. The weights are estimated using a random 1 percent sample of treated and untreated observations.

>* Each treated voter is matched to 25 untreated voter, and matching is done with replacement.

>* The matching procedure resulted in strong improvements across all the factors on which we match.

### Conclusions and Next Steps

>* Explore what might be at play in California and Georgia
>    * The CCES 2018 data might be able to show what is going on if incumbent recall is the mechanism (but not efficacy)
>    * Or maybe the top-two primary in California might explain some of the difference

>* The represented party tends to be more likely to vote than the unrepresented party
>    * Except in Texas and Wisconsin, which both had competitive statewide races

>* What are the overtime effects?
>    * Replicate the same methods in 2020 and 2022
